- Differential sync: Only send changed fields, not entire objects

**Data Model:**
- Each task has: `id` (UUID), `user_id`, `title`, `description`, `due_date`, `priority`, `status`, `created_at`, `updated_at`, `deleted_at` (soft delete)
- Timestamp-based conflict resolution: `updated_at` determines latest version
- Sync token: Track last sync timestamp per device

**Offline-First Approach:**
- Local database is source of truth
- All operations write to local DB first (instant UI update)
- Background service syncs to cloud when online
- Conflict resolution on sync failure (prompt user if critical)

**Sync Optimization:**
- Batch API calls (sync up to 100 tasks per request)
- Compression: gzip API responses
- Incremental sync: Use `last_sync_timestamp` to fetch only new/changed tasks

---

### 8.3 Notification System

**Push Notifications:**
- iOS: Apple Push Notification Service (APNs)
- Android: Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM)

**Local Notifications:**
- Scheduled on-device for time-based reminders
- More reliable than relying on push (works offline)

**Notification Queue:**
- Backend maintains notification schedule
- Sends push at specified time OR device schedules local notification
- Handle timezone differences correctly

**User Preferences:**
- Store notification settings in user profile (synced)
- Allow granular control: Reminders, Streaks, Achievements, Marketing (opt-in only)

---

### 8.4 Location Services (for Location Reminders)

**Implementation:**
- iOS: Core Location framework
- Android: Google Play Services Location API

**Geofencing:**
- Circular geofence (500m radius) around specified location
- Enter/Exit triggers
- Battery-efficient: Use significant location change, not continuous GPS

**Privacy:**
- Request "When in Use" location permission initially
- Clearly explain why location needed (for location-based reminders)
- User can disable location reminders in settings

## 10. Risks & Mitigation

### 10.1 Technical Risks

**Risk 1: Sync Conflicts at Scale**
- **Impact:** Data loss or inconsistent state across devices
- **Probability:** Medium
- **Mitigation:**
  - Robust conflict resolution algorithm (last-write-wins + user prompt for critical conflicts)
  - Extensive testing with multiple devices
  - Soft delete with recovery period
  - Sync logs for debugging

**Risk 2: AI Service Availability**
- **Impact:** AI task breakdown feature unavailable, user frustration
- **Probability:** Low-Medium
- **Mitigation:**
  - Implement fallback rule-based system
  - Cache AI responses for common task patterns
  - Clear user messaging when AI unavailable
  - Queue AI requests for retry
  - Make AI optional, not critical path

**Risk 3: Push Notification Delivery**
- **Impact:** Users miss reminders, reduced app value
- **Probability:** Medium (APNs/FCM have occasional issues)
- **Mitigation:**
  - Prefer local notifications for scheduled reminders
  - Use push as backup/supplement
  - Allow users to test notifications in settings
  - Monitor notification delivery rates

**Risk 4: Battery Drain from Location Services**
- **Impact:** User complaints, uninstalls
- **Probability:** Medium if not optimized
- **Mitigation:**
  - Use significant location change (not GPS polling)
  - Make location reminders opt-in
  - Monitor battery usage in analytics
  - Provide user control (on/off toggle)

---

### 10.2 User Adoption Risks

**Risk 5: Low User Engagement**
- **Impact:** Poor retention, failed product-market fit
- **Probability:** High (productivity app market is crowded)
- **Mitigation:**
  - Strong onboarding: Show value immediately (create first task in 10 seconds)
  - Gamification hooks users early (first achievement within 24 hours)
  - Push notifications for streak reminders (re-engagement)
  - A/B test features to optimize engagement
  - User research: Monthly interviews with churned users

**Risk 6: AI Suggestions Perceived as Inaccurate**
- **Impact:** Users distrust AI, disable feature
- **Probability:** Medium (AI not perfect)
- **Mitigation:**
  - Set expectations: "AI suggestions to get you started"
  - Easy to edit/dismiss suggestions
  - Track acceptance rate, iterate on prompts
  - Allow users to provide feedback on suggestions
  - Don't force AI, make it optional enhancement

**Risk 7: Privacy Concerns**
- **Impact:** Negative press, low trust, regulatory issues
- **Probability:** Low-Medium
- **Mitigation:**
  - Transparent privacy policy (plain language)
  - Minimal data collection (only functional data)
  - Clear in-app disclosures for AI usage
  - GDPR/CCPA compliance from Day 1
  - Optional features require opt-in (location, AI)

**Risk 8: Competitive Pressure**
- **Impact:** Losing market share to established players (Todoist, Things, TickTick)
- **Probability:** High
- **Mitigation:**
  - Focus on differentiation: AI + gamification + analytics (unique combo)
  - Superior UX: Faster, cleaner, more delightful
  - Community building: Engaged user base as moat
  - Rapid iteration: Ship features faster than competitors
  - Strategic partnerships: Integration with popular tools

### 10.3 Business Risks

**Risk 9: Monetization Challenges**
- **Impact:** Unsustainable business model
- **Probability:** Medium
- **Mitigation:**
  - Build engaged free user base first (focus on PMF)
  - Introduce freemium in Phase 2 (premium features, not paywalls)
  - Explore B2B: Team plans for companies
  - Alternative: Sponsorships, partnerships (avoid ads)

**Risk 10: Scaling Costs (AI API)**
- **Impact:** High per-user costs eat into margins
- **Probability:** Medium at scale
- **Mitigation:**
  - Cache common AI responses
  - Rate limit AI calls per user (e.g., 10/day for free users)
  - Explore cheaper AI providers or self-hosted models
  - Premium tier with unlimited AI usage

## 11. Open Questions & Assumptions

### 11.1 Open Questions

**Product Questions:**
1. **How many tasks is too many?** Should we cap tasks per user (e.g., 500 active tasks) to maintain performance?
2. **AI accuracy threshold:** What acceptance rate for AI suggestions is "good enough" to keep the feature?
3. **Gamification balance:** At what point does gamification become overwhelming or feel childish?
4. **Team collaboration depth:** Should MVP include any team features, or purely individual focus?
5. **Monetization timing:** When should we introduce premium features? (Day 1, or after X users/months?)

**Technical Questions:**
1. **Cross-platform code sharing:** Should we invest in KMM/React Native, or keep native apps separate?
2. **AI model choice:** Fine-tuned smaller model vs. GPT-4 API calls (cost vs. quality trade-off)?
3. **Real-time sync:** Is WebSocket overkill for MVP, or essential for great UX?
4. **Data residency:** Do we need region-specific data storage (EU, US, Asia) for compliance?

**UX Questions:**
1. **Onboarding length:** 3-screen tutorial vs. zero tutorial (learn by doing)?
2. **Notification frequency:** What's optimal for engagement without being annoying?
3. **Default view:** Should app open to "Today" or "All Tasks"?
